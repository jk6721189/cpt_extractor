If multiple areas are <br />aspirated, report 10004\u201310012 and 10021 for each site taken and append modifier 59 or an X{EPSU} modifier to the additional <br />codes. For evaluation of fine needle aspirate, see 88172\u201388173. For percutaneous placement of a localization device during breast <br />biopsy, see 19081\u201319086.

For percutaneous image-guided fluid collection drainage of soft tissue via catheter, see 10030.  If biopsies <br />are performed on two or more lesions during the same session using the same imaging source, report the appropriate imaging code <br />for the second and subsequent lesions; if using a different imaging source, report the additional add-on lesion biopsy codes and <br />the code for each separate imaging source used. When FNA biopsy and core needle biopsies are performed during the same session on <br />separate lesions using the same imaging source, both the core needle biopsy and the imaging guidance are reported separately using <br />modifier 59. When FNA biopsy and core needle biopsies are performed during the same session on separate lesions using a different <br />imaging source, both the core needle biopsy and the imaging guidance are reported separately using modifier 59. Report 10004 in <br />addition to 10021; 10006 in addition to 10005; 10008 in addition to 10007; 10010 in addition to 10009; and 10012 in addition to <br />10011.

 <br />   "lay_description": "Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a diagnostic percutaneous procedure that uses a fine gauge needle (often <br />22 or 25 gauge) and a syringe to sample fluid from a cyst or remove clusters of cells from a solid mass. The skin is cleansed. If <br />a lump can be felt, the radiologist or surgeon guides a needle into the area by palpating the lump. If the lump is non-palpable, <br />the FNA procedure is performed using ultrasound, fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), or MR imaging with the patient positioned <br />according to the area of concern. Ultrasonography-guided aspiration biopsy involves inserting an aspiration catheter needle device <br />through the accessory channel port of the echoendoscope; the needle is placed into the area to be sampled under endoscopic <br />ultrasonographic guidance. After the needle is placed into the region of the lesion, a vacuum is created and multiple in and out <br />needle motions are performed. Several needle insertions are usually required to ensure that an adequate tissue sample is taken. In <br />fluoroscopic guidance, intermittent fluoroscopy guides the advancement of the needle. CT image guidance allows computer-assisted <br />targeting of the area to be sampled. At the completion of the procedure, the needle is withdrawn and a small bandage is placed over <br />the area. MR image guidance involves the use of a magnetic field, radiowaves, and computer-assisted targeting to identify the area <br />for biopsy without the use of ionizing radiation. Report 10021 for fine needle aspiration of the initial lesion performed without <br />imaging guidance; for each subsequent lesion, report 10004. Report 10005 for FNA of the first lesion using ultrasound guidance; <br />for each additional lesion, report 10006. Report 10007 for FNA of the first lesion using fluoroscopy; for each additional lesion, <br />report 10008. Report 10009 for FNA of the first lesion utilizing CT imaging; for each subsequent lesion, report 10010. Report <br />10011 when MR imaging is used for the initial lesion; for each additional lesion, report 10012.",
